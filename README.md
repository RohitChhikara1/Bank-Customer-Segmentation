# Bank-Customer-Segmentation
This is my 2nd Project based on Unsupervised Machine Learning.

Customer segmentation, the process of categorizing customers based on shared characteristics, behaviours and preferences is an invaluable tool for banks. By segmenting their customer base, banks can personalize services, optimize resource allocation and drive growth. This project explores the implementation of customer segmentation strategies to enhance customer experience and boost business performance.
